		<h1>Sibelius Tutorials Project Diary</h1>
		<br/>
		<em><h2>For each day I work on the tutorials, I'll outline what I've learnt. This is a record that I can come back to and understand, and I've done my best to make it understandable for anyone else who can use this information. For the full tutorials, go here: <a href="http://hub.sibelius.com/download/documentation/pdfs/sibelius713-tutorials-en.pdf">Sibelius 7 Tutorials</a></h2></em>

		<br/>Versions: In Review>Versions you can create, edit and view different versions of the same score. This is useful if you wat to experiment, but keep the original as well. Like parts, versions can be opened in the same window, making it easy to swap between.

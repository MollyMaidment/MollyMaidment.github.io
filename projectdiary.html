		<em><h2>For each day I work on the tutorials, I'll outline what I've learnt in a simple list style. This isn't a "Dear Diary" (sorry to disappoint), this is a record that I can come back to and easily understand.</h2></em>

		<h3>Day 1 (Tutorial 1)</h3>
		<p>Panels: In View>Panels there is a group of tools to help with different features of Sibelius. One of these is the Navigator, which shows the entire score in miniature with a smaller box showing which part of the score you are viewing.
		<br/>Panorama: In View>DocumentView there is a panorama option, which shows the score in one long line.
		<br/>Versions: In Review>Versions you can create, edit and view different versions of the same score. This is useful if you wat to experiment, but keep the original as well. Like parts, versions can be opened in the same window, making it easy to swap between.
		<br/>Hiding & Focusing Staves: In Layout>HidingStaves there are options to show only particular staves, or remove empty staves from view.
		<br/>Keyboard Shortcuts: 
		<br/>	Esc = deselect everything
		<br/>	Left Arrow = moves forwards through music one object at a time (for one instrument)
		<br/>	Command, Left Arrow = moves forward through music one bar at a time (for one instrument)
		<br/>	Tab = selects first object in view
		<br/>	Shidt, Tab = moves back one object at a time (for one instrument)</p><br/>

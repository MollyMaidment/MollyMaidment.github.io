		<h1>Sibelius Practice Project Report</h1>
		<br/>
		<em><h2>This is a summary of my second project.</h2></em>
		<br/>
		<p>For my second negotiated project of the semester I continued working with Sibelius, the composition program I worked through several tutorials on in my first project. This time, I focussed more on practically applying the skills I had learnt previously, with the goal of completing a composition by the end of the project. With few problems I managed to complete this goal, and throughout the project continued to encounter new features and options for using the software.
		<br/>
		<br/>I knew from day one that writing an entire piece of music – that I could be satisfied with at the end – within the limited time span of the project was an impossible task. Therefore, I decided to instead use the time to finish a composition I had already started; the only question was which one. I had two that I was currently working on, or that were “active”. I decided on the piece I was writing for a brass octet. It wasn’t my first attempt writing for brass, but my first hopeful one, and I knew the ideas I had written so far would need a lot of work before they could be called good music. I also believed there was enough time to fix what needed fixing. I was wrong.
		<br/>
		<br/>Although I managed to write several pages of notes and rhythms and nice-sounding chords by the time second term rolled around, I had done nothing on my project over the holidays, and I was beginning to lose hope that the ideas I had blurted onto the screen could ever form a proper piece of music. Even before the holidays began, my final few Creative Media lessons of term one were tinged by a feeling of doom for the brass octet.
		<br/>
		<br/>In second term, with the project’s end in clear, ominous sight, I decidedly set aside the sounding-like-everything-else brassy mess I had created, and averted my attention to the other “active” option I had: a piece for solo piano, written back in the summer holidays which was gradually being cleaned up and rearranged over the course of the following months. Hope restored a little, I buckled down to give it a final look over, pedantically making sure every detail fitted, that nothing stood out, that the music looked the way it should for anyone who might ever play it.
		<br/>
		<br/>I completed the piano piece within the deadline, and (surprisingly) being satisfied with it, had also completed the goal of my project. Quite by accident I also discovered new aspects of Sibelius during the project. Some of them I’ve had little use for so far, like the dictionary, but others I’ve used a lot more, like the performance settings, which effect how the playback sounds. I’m currently asking around to see if anyone’s interested in playing the piano piece. The brass quartet remains as yet unreturned to, or, if we’re going with the terminology I like to use for all my composition and wring, it is “dormant”. Perhaps one day I’ll wake it up again.

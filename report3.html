		<h1>Sibelius More-Practice Project Report</h1>
		<br/>
		<em><h2>A summary of my third project.</h2></em>
		<br/>
		<p>My third negotiated project again used Sibelius, the composition program I explored during my first two projects. The purpose of the third project was, once again, applying the skills relating the Sibelius that I already have, practicing them, and maybe learning one or two new things along the way. The goal was also the same, namely finishing a composition using Sibelius – though not necessarily starting it within the time frame of the project.
		<br/>
		<br/>To find something I could work with within the time frame provided, I browsed even further back through my folders, into the “dormant” folder. My find was another piano piece, this time from about a year ago. I had named the piece as a sonata, which meant though it was as yet unfinished I had intended it to be in sonata form.
		<br/>
		<br/>Sonata form has no simple explanation. In fact, you could go several pages deep into the internet, read fifty different definitions, and still not have a clue. Honestly I’m still not completely certain exactly what a sonata is, but my basic understanding at the time I started the piece was more certain than the one I have now, so we’ll go with that. My amateur understanding was that sonata form consisted of three movements (three separate parts to the piece) of different tempo (speed at which they’re played). The first movement is usually fast (for instance, an <em>allegro</em>), the second slower (usually andante or <em>adagio</em>), and the third fast again (often <em>allegro</em> or <em>presto</em>). Mine, with the two movements I’d already done when I found it being <em>allegro</em> and <em>adagio</em>, has ended up being <em>allegro</em>, then <em>moderato</em> (moderate), then <em>allegro</em>.
		<br/>
		<br/>About half of what I compose is for piano, as the instrument is useable with various styles of music, and remains the only instrument properly able to have chords and melodies and all sorts of things going on at once, yet still play solo. In other words: who needs ensembles when you’ve got a piano? The answer is, of course, because as much as pianos sound nice, sometimes it just isn’t the sound you want. This became the case with this particular piece, so I began trying out different arrangements and groups of instruments, eventually deciding on alto flute and two French horns.
		<br/>
		<br/>I didn’t really have many problems until, when backing up all the files on my laptop and deleting some things, I accidently deleted the folder Sibelius Sounds, which has all the instrument sound files for the program. I could still use Sibelius, but I couldn’t play back anything, so in the last week of the project I focussed on fixing the format of the music – which gone a bit odd and was spaced wrong – and adding dynamics and articulations and other final touches. Once I’ve re-downloaded the sounds, I’ll be able to hear if it actually sounds any good or not.

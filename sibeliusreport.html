		<h1>Sibelius Tutorials Project Report</h1>
		<br/>
		<em><h2>This is a brief look back over my experience with the Sibelius Tutorials, and the conclusion of the project.</h2></em>
		<br/>
		<p>Sibelius is one of the more advanced composition programs, and becoming more popular. It allows you to input music of a complex standard with ease, play back that music with a range of instruments and sounds, and export scores, audio, video, graphics, etc. 
		<br/>
		<br/>A variety of notation and text options are provided, so that the user is not limited in the music they create, but a side effect of this is learning how to navigate everything and how to navigate it in an efficient way. Sibelius provides a set of tutorials to work through all this, providing information on the basic workings of the program. Without these tutorials a lot of it is pretty easy to work out by oneself, and the software is perfectly useable to a certain point with this limited knowledge. However, some notation options and extra features are harder to find like this, and if you aren’t great at working out keyboard shortcuts by yourself, using Sibelius can be a slow, clunky and tedious process. The tutorials provide the tools to access panels, plug-ins, uncommon notation and text, and all the keyboard shortcuts needed.
		<br/>
		<br/>There are three main Sibelius tutorials, with an extra two for the more advanced that I didn't get to. Within the first three there were basic parts like opening new projects, inputting notes, notations and text, and exporting that I’d already figured out, and could skip. There were also parts using MIDI keyboards and the like which I skipped, as I don’t have access to those resources and they aren’t a main focus for me at this point. I wasn’t following the tutorials word-for-word either, taking in the information I needed and working it out in a broader sense rather than doing the quite particular tasks set. This meant I can in future easily use the tools in more varied situations.
		<br/>
		<br/>A main issue was the keyboard shortcuts; although there were options for both mac and windows computers, it seemed to be an assumption that the user would use a desktop computer rather than a laptop. Because of this, the keyboards shortcuts didn’t always line up properly. There was a link to a more detailed information booklet, which showed the keyboard shortcuts for laptops, and at first I used that list a bit, but it was tricky to find and wasn’t great to navigate, so eventually I gave up on it. From that point on, if a keyboard shortcut didn’t work, I pressed similar key or series of keys until it worked. A reliable tactic, as it turned out. I now have forty-seven keyboard shortcuts that – eventually – I will remember well enough to use smoothly. And one day I’ll be able to find everything in the ribbon without consulting my own webpage.

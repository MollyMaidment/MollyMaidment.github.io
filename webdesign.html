		<h1>Web Design</h1>
		<p>There are many things to take into consideration when designing and creating a web page, including a few widely agreed upon and some less common – but more particular – points. By comparing five web-design checklists, I sorted the former from the latter, and selected the most useful/best from that list:</p>
		<br/><h4>Common:
		<br/>
		<br/>Simplicity
		<br/>User-friendly
		<br/>Consistent
		<br/>Audience & purpose
		<br/>Appealing
		<br/><br/><br/><br/>
		<br/>Particular:
		<br/>
		<br/>Whitespace
		<br/>Focuses
		<br/>URL
		<br/>3 levels of headers
		<br/>2 fonts at most
		<br/>Font size 14+
		<br/>Links/icons clear
		<br/>Browser compatibility</h4>
		<br/>
		<br/><p>A lot of the Particular list fits into one of the points on the more vague Common list, such as a maximum of two fonts fits into simplicity, but these Particular points seem worth noting and make good examples. You could view it as the Commons being areas to consider, and the Particulars as guides.
		<br/>
		</p>
		<br/><h2>So, here’s the Common Points:</h2>
		<p>Now for some normal writing, nothing special. Don't tell it that though because it still has feelings.</p>
		<h3>Simplicity</h3>
		<p>Surprisingly, this one was not on every list. Often it was referred to in an exact context, such as keeping background and text colour simple (<a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~montecin/webdesign.htm">Montecino</a>, n.d.), but not overall. Its importance is fairly obvious though, and weaves in with some of the other points like consistency, appeal and being user-friendly.</p>
		<h3>User-friendly</h3>
		<p>Although in different wording, a need for web pages to be user-friendly was outlined on pretty much every list. There’s no point having a web page in the first place if it’s too confusing or difficult for anyone to use.</p>
		<h3>Consistent</h3>
		<p>Consistency connects in with simplicity, as both help to make the page easy to use and understand. Both also make a page easier to create in the first place.</p>
		<h3>Audience & Purpose</h3>
		<p>The colour and font of text, the background you choose, even the format and language you use in displaying your content, all depends on who your audience is, and what the purpose of you web page is. After all, those are the reasons you’re making a page at all, right? Even if you’re just doing it to kill time, that makes the audience you, and the purpose Time Killing.</p>
		<h3>Appealing</h3>
		<p>Again, this connects into some of the other points, such as consistency, simplicity, audience & purpose, and making it user friendly. Oh wait, that’s all of them… am I the only one seeing a pattern? “Just make it look good” is basically what this means, I suppose.</p>
		<br/><h2>And now for the Particulars:<h3>
		<h3>Whitespace</h3>
		<p>Simplicity. Whitespace – or negative space, if you’re a pessimist – can be what makes or breaks your web page. You need to leave room for the eye and brain to rest, while also focusing in on what’s important.</p>
		<h3>Focuses</h3>
		<p>What’s important on this page? What ‘s the point of it? Why should anyone look at it? Make what matters obvious and easy to find, hopefully with out shouting, sirens or crazy lights. Don’t stoop to that level.</p>
		<h3>URL</h3>
		<p>I hadn’t thought of this one until it came up on the third checklist I looked at (<a href=": https://www.webpixeltechnologies.com/web-design-checklist/">webpixeltechnologies.com</a>). Having a snappy, professional – or not, if that’s what you’re going for – URL might just get you brownie points, but it’s not always necessary. On a side-note, another option is to stop staring at computer screens and just make brownies yourself, that way you retain the right to eat them all yourself.</p>
		<h3>Three Levels of Headers</h3>
		<p>“Studies agree that three levels are generally the happy medium for most websites” (<a href="http://vintage.agency/blog/the-ultimate-web-design-review-checklist/">Vintage Blog</a>, 2016). I can roll with that, but I suppose it really depends on context more than as a general rule. You do you.</p>
		<h3>Two Fonts at Most</h3>
		<p>Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity. What else is there to say? Oh yeah: consistency, consistency, consistency.</p>
		<h3>Font Size 14+</h3>
		<p>Your content needs to be readable. You can’t always predict the exacts of your audience, so it’s better to be safe and make the content bigger, rather than risk losing audience because your text is too small.</p>
		<h3>LInks/Icons Clear</h3>
		<p>Especially if your web page links to other pages, navigation is important; don’t make things difficult to find.</p>
		<h3>Browser Compatibility</h3>
		<p>Try opening your web page in a few different browsers, and see how it looks. If you’re happy with result, congratulations, you’ve done well. If not, work out what the issue is and fix it, then try again. The more browsers you try the better.</p>
		<br/><h2>So there you have it.</h2>
		<p>For the full. colour-coded list and matching colour-coded sources see below; the colours of the dot-points match their source.</p>
